## NodeJS Complete Guide from Udemy

This repository is based on [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide)

### Why?

After almost 5 years of working as DevOps Engineer I have recently decided to move on, and go back to software development, thus 
I want to refresh my programming skills - but as I am not sure which path to follow - Ruby, Elixir, Python, etc., I decided to start with taking up 
NodeJS course.

To keep things clean, I'll track my progress on separate branches.
